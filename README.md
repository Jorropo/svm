## SVM (Spacemesh Virtual Machine)

This repository will implement the _Spacemesh_ smart contracts vm.

### Project Goals
* Self-contained. Should be hosted by the [Spacemesh Golang](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh) full-node and future _Spacemesh_ Rust full-node
* Build on top of [wasmer](https://wasmer.io)
* Future compatible for the _SMESH_ programming-language (the language is still in a research stage).
