## SVM (Spacemesh Virtual Machine)

This repository will implement the _Spacemesh_ smart contracts vm.


### Project Goals
* Self-contained. Should be hosted by the [Spacemesh Golang](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh) full-node and future _Spacemesh_ Rust full-node
* Built on top of [wasmer](https://wasmer.io)
* Future compatible for the _SMESH_ programming-language (the language is still in a research stage).


### Rust
`SVM` depends on the single-pass compiler of `wasmer` which requires the `rust nightly` release channel.
More information about installing `rust nightly` can be [found here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.2.0/book/nightly-rust.html)


### Got Questions?
